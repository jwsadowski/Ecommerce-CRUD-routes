# ECOMMERCE CRUD ROUTES

## Overview

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

This project requires the back end to be built for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You'll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story
